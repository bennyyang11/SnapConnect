# ðŸŽ¨ AI-Powered Dynamic Stickers Demo

## Overview
I've successfully integrated OpenAI's DALL-E API into your SnapConnect PhotoEditor to create AI-powered dynamic stickers! This allows users to generate custom overlays by simply describing what they want to add to their photos.

## âœ¨ New Features Added

### 1. **AI Sticker Generator Button**
- New "âœ¨ AI Sticker" button in the top right controls
- Red/pink colored button for easy identification
- Opens AI generation modal when tapped

### 2. **AI Generation Modal**
- Beautiful dark-themed modal with:
  - Text input for describing the desired sticker
  - Example prompts: "small cute dinosaur", "rainbow", "unicorn"
  - Generate button with loading spinner
  - Cancel option

### 3. **Dynamic Overlay System**
- Generated images appear as draggable overlays on photos/videos
- Each overlay starts centered on the screen
- Interactive controls for manipulation

### 4. **Overlay Management**
- **Tap to Control**: Tap any overlay to get action menu with:
  - Move Left/Right/Up/Down (20px increments)
  - Resize: Normal â†’ 1.5x â†’ 0.5x â†’ Normal
  - Delete individual overlay
- **Quick Delete**: Red X button on each overlay for instant removal
- **Clear All**: Button appears when overlays exist to remove all at once

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### DALL-E Integration
```javascript
const generateAIOverlay = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'dall-e-3',
      prompt: `${overlayPrompt}, transparent background, sticker style, high quality, isolated object`,
      n: 1,
      size: '1024x1024',
      quality: 'standard',
      style: 'natural'
    }),
  });
};
```

### Overlay Data Structure
```typescript
interface AIOverlay {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  imageUri: string;     // DALL-E generated image URL
  x: number;           // Horizontal position
  y: number;           // Vertical position
  scale: number;       // Size multiplier (0.5, 1, 1.5)
  prompt: string;      // Original user description
}
```

### Smart Prompt Enhancement
The system automatically enhances user prompts with:
- "transparent background" - for clean overlay integration
- "sticker style" - for appropriate visual treatment
- "high quality, isolated object" - for better results

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Flow

1. **Take/Select Photo**: User has photo in PhotoEditor
2. **Tap AI Sticker**: "âœ¨ AI Sticker" button opens generation modal
3. **Describe Sticker**: Type what they want (e.g., "small cute dinosaur")
4. **Generate**: AI creates custom sticker in ~3-5 seconds
5. **Position & Resize**: Tap to move and resize the generated sticker
6. **Multiple Stickers**: Generate as many as desired
7. **Final Touch**: Share photo with custom AI-generated overlays
